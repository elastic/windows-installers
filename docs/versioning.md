# versioning
- determining which versions are available is via `./build/scripts/Feeds.fsx: module ArtifactsFeed` which queries `https://artifacts-api.elastic.co/v1`
- product guids are at `./src/Installer/Elastic.Installer.Domain/ProductGuids.cs` which is generated by `./build/scripts/BuildConfig.fsx: module BuildConfig`
- product specific upgrade/migration scenarios are handled via `./src/InstallerHosts\Elastic.InstallerHosts.[ProductName]\App.cs`
